 Repository for Homework #15

Homework takes "samples.json" as an input.  Parses through the data and organizes it in order to be presented in dashboard format.

The dashboard allows us to select a test subject, then view various datapoints such as:

- Demographic Data

- Weekly Wash Frequency in a gauge graphic

- Horizontal Graph displaying top 10 OTUs found per test subject

- Bubble Graph showing the concentration of ALL OTUs per test specie, where the bubble size increases with the presence of the OTU
